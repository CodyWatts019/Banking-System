In this program I will present a number of variation of a program that sumlates running a bank. In each new version of the program, I'll add more functionality.Note that these programs are not production-readuu; invalid user entries or misuse will lead to errors. The intent is to have you focus on how the code interacts with the data associated with one or more bank accounts.

To start, consider what operations a client would want to do with a bank account and what data would be needed to represent an account.

ANALYSIS OF REQUIRED OPERATION & DATA
A list of operations a person would want to do with a bank account would include:
-Create (an account)
-Deposite
-Withdraw
-Check Balance
    Next, hrer is a minimal list of the data we would need  to represent a bank account:
    -Customer Name
    -Password
    -Balance
